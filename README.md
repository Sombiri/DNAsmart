# DNAsmart: DNA Storage Multi-Attribute Ranking Tool

The aim of this tool is to visually represent the effect of attribute weights on the ranking of decoded sequences. To support the ranking of these decoded sequences, from a DNA storage system or experiment, the introduction of weights on certain attributes leads to a specific ranking (favoring specific sequences). By relying on sorting and grouping of such attributes, we obtain an interactive change in the ranking of the best sequences. The rationale is to be able to provide insight into the attribute space by using different attribute combinations. For example, which attribute combination leads to the optimal sequence or Top 3 sequences to compare encoding experiments.

## Dependencies

* Node.js

## Usage
### General Usage
1. Go to [DNAsmart](https://dnasmart.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/)
2. Upload your data sets, click Next
